# -Guidelines-for-Pollutant-Processing-and-Potential-Public-Health
This repository hosts a reference table outlining guidelines for pollutant processing and potential public health impacts, based on the WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines (22 September 2021). It covers key pollutants—including PM2.5, PM10, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide—along with recommended limits, time sensitivities, and priority levels. The goal is to provide researchers and policymakers with a concise resource for understanding and managing air quality risks in accordance with WHO standards.

Table 2: WHO Guidelines for Pollutant Processing and Potential Public Health

| Pollutant                   | Potential Health Impact                                                | Deadline (Minutes) | Time Sensitive | Priority  |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|----------|
| PM2.5                       | Causes severe respiratory and heart issues, increasing mortality risk. | 2                  | Immediate      | High      |
| PM10                        | Aggravates asthma and bronchitis, leading to breathing difficulties.    | 2                  | Immediate      | High      |
| NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide)      | Irritates airways, reduces lung function, worsens asthma.              | 2                  | Routine        | Moderate  |
| SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide)        | Triggers coughing, throat irritation, and bronchial constriction.      | 2                  | Routine        | Moderate  |
| CO (Carbon Monoxide)        | Impairs oxygen transport, causing headaches, nausea, and fatigue.      | 2                  | Immediate      | High      |
| O3 (Ozone)                  | Induces asthma attacks, reduces lung capacity, can irritate airways.    | 3                  | Delayed        | Low       |
| VOCs (Volatile Organic...)  | Includes carcinogens and irritants; can worsen respiratory conditions.  | 3                  | Routine        | Moderate  |
| Xylenes                     | Causes neurological symptoms like headaches and dizziness.             | 3                  | Delayed        | Low       |
| Visibility Reducing...      | Indirectly affects respiratory and cardiovascular health.              | 3                  | Delayed        | Low       |
| TSP (Total Suspended...)    | Similar to PM2.5 and PM10, it aggravates asthma, reduces lung function. | 5                  | Delayed        | Moderate  |
| Benzene                     | Increases leukemia risks, causes blood disorders, weakens the immune system. | 5              | Delayed        | Moderate  |
| CO2 (Carbon Dioxide)        | At high levels, causes headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath.       | 5                  | Delayed        | Low       |
| Formaldehyde                | Irritates eyes and respiratory system, linked to certain cancers.       | 3                  | Immediate      | High      |
